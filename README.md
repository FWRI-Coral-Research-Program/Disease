# Disease

## Overview:

This repository will house all scripts used to clean and analyze Cnidarian disease data in the Florida Keys, Southeastern Florida, and Dry Tortugas National Park. The data comes from in-situ surveys on stony coral condition, the analysis of which covers everything from bleaching, color loss, tissue abnormalities, and a long list of diseases. Percent mortality (old and recent) for each observed colony are utilized in the analysis of stony coral condition.

## The Program:

The Coral Reef Evaluation & Monitoring Program (CREMP) has been monitoring corals in Florida's coastal waters since 1996. Currently, there are a total of 77 monitoring sites from Southeastern Florida, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and Dry Tortugas National Park. Different combinations thereof may be used in certain condition or disease surveys. For example, this repository contains scripts that summarize Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease prevalence across 56 sites that were determined to be most emblematic of the condition.

## Codes

The following table shows the condition abbreviations, or condition codes, that are recorded in the field during surveys. They are typically recorded with further information regarding distribution and percent affected.
